# Eventify – College Event Management (Static Frontend)
A clean, GitHub Pages–ready project for listing events, creating drafts (UI only), and letting students register with a downloadable pass—all without a backend.

## Pages
- `index.html` – Landing page
- `events.html` – Browse & filter events (data from `assets/events.json`)
- `create.html` – UI form to draft an event and export JSON
- `register.html` – Register for an event and download a simple pass
- `contact.html` – Static contact form

## Deploy
Push to a GitHub repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `/ (root)` or `/docs`.

## Customize
- Add/modify events in `assets/events.json`.
- Replace images in `assets/images/`.
- Edit styles in `assets/style.css`.
